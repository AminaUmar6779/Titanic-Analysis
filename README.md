# Titanic-Analysis

## Project Overview

The main aim of the analysis is to predict the survival status of passengers that boarded the Titanic ship using various features, including age, gender, ticket class, and other variables. The problem statement of the dataset is important because it provides insight into the factors that influenced passenger survival rates during the Titanic disaster.is aimed at providing insights and recommendations.

## Data Sources

The datasetwas gotttn from data.world and can be downloaded from https://data.world/nrippner/titanic-disaster-dataset. The datset conaing detailed information about the passengers on board the titanic ship.

## Tools

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
 I performed the following rasks;

Data Loading and inspection

Removing null values and irrelevant columns

Removing blank spaces

Merging some columns 

Creating new column

Replacing column names to more meaningful names

Data Formatting


## Exploratory Data Analysis
The total passengers onboard

Survival Rate

Death Rate

Survival Status by gender

Survival Status by Passenger class

Survival by Embarked city

## Data Analysis

Survival Rates: From our analysis, 38% of passengers survived while 62% died from the incident.

Survival Rates by Gender: Our analysis showed that females survived more compared to the males. Females had a higher survival rate compared to the males probably because they were given more priority at rescue time.

Survival Rates by Passenger Class: Our analysis showed that the third class had more passengers, 40% of them died while 14% survived. Second class passengers had 12% death rate and 9% survival rate, first class passengers who had the lowest population had a death rate of 9% and survival rate of 15%. So, we can conclude that passengers in the first class survived more than the second class and third class. Probable because first class passengers were given more priority and had access to the lifeboats compared to the second class sand third class passengers.

Survival Rates by Embarked city: From our analysis, passengers who embarked from Cherbourg had 11% survival rate and 9% death rate. Passengers who embarked from Queenstown had a lower survival rate compared to Cherbourg with 3% survival and 6% death rate. Passengers who embarked from Southampton had the highest mortality rate with 46% death and 23% survival. So, we can conclude that passengers from Southampton died the most even though passengers who embarked from Southampton were more than that of Cherbourg and Queenstown.


## Conclusion

My analysis shows that gender, passenger class, embarked city had a significant effect in the survival of the passengers in the ship. It indicates that women were given more priority than males. First class passengers were also given more priority than second class and third class. This could because the first-class passengers had more access to the lifeboats and the rescue time.

## Recommendations

Implement new safety measures such as ensuring that more lifeboats should be made available.
Passengers should be educated on the use of lifeboats.
